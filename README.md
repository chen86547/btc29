Wallets are a necessity for cryptocurrency storage. Each chain has its own underlying technology and its wallets are also different. Currently, if you want to expand the wallet market, multi-currency cross-chain wallets are good.

  The so-called multi-currency cross-chain means that multiple underlying currencies can be stored in one wallet for unified management, and in addition to normal storage and payment, some personalized gameplay can be added, such as socializing, following orders, holding currency to earn interest, etc. .
The digital asset wallet developed by Yuanzhongrui is divided into centralized and decentralized wallets. The technical difficulty of the two wallets is different, and the market requirements are also different. Function combinations can be carried out according to the specific needs of the project party.

The characteristic of a decentralized wallet is that the user's coins are stored on the chain rather than in the project's wallet, which allows users to feel more at ease. However, the disadvantage is that it is suitable for some games, applications, etc., and there is no recommendation mode. User income cannot be obtained through recommendations, but through gameplay such as application games. Digital asset wallet development

  Centralization uses some recommendation systems, transactions, currency holdings to earn interest, contracts and other methods to make profits. This is more convenient for market promotion, but the coins are stored in the wallet of the project team, which is relatively unfavorable for users. , but currently most of the wallets on the market are centralized wallets.

  At present, the wallet system built by Yuanzhongrui is available in multiple languages: java, .net, go and other language versions. The deployment time is fast (as short as one week, as long as half a month) and has comprehensive functions (currency exchange, transfer payment, etc.) Currency storage, holding currency to earn interest, etc.).
